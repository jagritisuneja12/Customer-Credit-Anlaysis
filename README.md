# Customer-Credit-Anlaysis

In this project, I developed a predictive model using Lasso regression in R to assess customer default risk, achieving a 72% accuracy rate. I employed feature selection and down sampling techniques to optimize the model's performance. Additionally, I utilized factor analysis to uncover hidden relationships between credit scores, income, and customer behavior, explaining 60.7% of the variance in the data. Correspondence analysis was applied to explore associations between categorical variables, such as family status and product preferences, providing critical insights for improving credit risk management strategies.
